# PythonStatistics
This project consists of two statistically focused Python programs.
The first program rolls custom dice and provides descriptive statistics for the rolls, with a chart to visualize the frequency of specific rolls occuring.
The second program reads a file containing numbers and provides descriptive statistics using my own custom functions to complete each statistical calcualtion.
